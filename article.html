        <h3>Managing the team</h3>
        <p>As a manager I currently focus on creating an enjoyable, productive and creatively challenging work experience. Making sure that everyday work takes my team members closer to their professional goals and career path.</p>
        <p>Together we set their priorities for the quarters and work on these through bi-weekly syncs where we assess how far we come and what can we do to get them closer to their objective. Be by providing them with courses, literature, conferences, speaking opportunities and more.</p>
        <p>Here are some key points that we have being focusing on as a design team in order to improve the quality of our work and our relationship with other deparments:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data literacy:</strong> how to read, write and interpret quantitative data by understanding the fundamentals of statistics and learning how to use tools such as Google Sheets, Python and Metabase.</li>
          <li><strong>Research and psychology:</strong> understanding the biases at play in user-interface relationships and how to interpret qualitative user research findings.</li>
          <li><strong>Engineering 101:</strong> foundations of front and backend development; HTML, CSS and JS basics as well as database and software architecture.</li>
          <li><strong>User communication:</strong> the principles of user scheduling via CRM; task completion and motivation via copywriting; entry funnels with marketing campaigns; and why UX should collaborate with all of these channels.</li>
          <li><strong>Design architecture:</strong> the importance of a strong design language that has functionality and frontend development in mind, while having a top shelf UI.</li>
