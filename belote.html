          <h2>Belote</h2>
          <blockquote cite="http://">A multi-platform Belote card game application</blockquote>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>The card game Belote was invented around 1920 in France, and is a close relative of both Klaberjass and Klaverjas, its respective German and Dutch counterparts.</p>
          <p>Belote is known as France’s national card game and by far the most played card game in the country of the city of lights. It is a typical trick-taking game that revolves around, in the initial round, defining a trump suit that affects the game structure for the actual play.</p>
          <p>With all this historical weight in the company's shoulders they were very aware that when they set themselves to develop this game, they would have a lot of respect to pay to such an old darling of the French. And that is what they did and what we’ve continued.</p>
          <p>This can be seen in the data itself, given that after the changes where made the game sat at 2nd in Grossing in the Card category in France’s AppStore (42nd in the Game’s category), 5th in Free Games and 1st in Free Card Games. In France’s Google Play store it sat comfortably as 3rd in Grossing in the Card category (72nd in the Game’s category), 1st in Free Games and 1st in Free Card Games.</p>
          <h3>Analysis</h3>
          <p>When the UX and UX Research where called upon to inspect the existing game right away we noticed some possible improvements that could be done but, as good UX folks, we wanted first to validate that our improvements where what the audience was looking for.</p>
          <p>Therefore, in order to better understand what our players wanted we’ve issued a wide reaching survey to our players and, in tandem, we schedule interviews with them so that we could have a deeper sense of their frustrations, satisfactions and aspirations for the product.</p>
          <p>As an outcome of that, we zeroed in certain topics that were dear to the audience and luckily a few of those matched our initial analysis of problematic systems that were there.</p>
          <p>The main points that we collected from our audience and internally where: Client implementation inconsistencies, difficulty of understanding the existing Tournament feature and desire for an offline tournament.</p>
          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>After having issued the initial wide reaching survey, performing a frequency analysis of the topics mentioned by users (collected via a freehand text input) and prioritising them. We were ready to follow up in-depth with these topics.</p>
          <p>Hence, the User Research team and I set down to have a discussion to decide which would be the best validation strategy and methods that we could deploy to guarantee reliable results when answering the different questions that rose from the initial survey.</p>
          <p>Together we decided that in order to test the consistency across our different client implementations we would issue a usability test where users would perform the same exact task in all different client implementations: iPhone, Android, Facebook (using Smartphones, Tablets and Laptops). That way we would be able to tell the different issues that players noticed across implementations.</p>
          <p>Concerning the in-game tournament and the fact that users where unaware of the rules, we decided to create a tutorial that would cover all the basic points of understanding of the feature. The tutorial would be tested in its prototype form and after going over the prototype users would answer a “quiz” that would gage how much information they have retained by going through the prototype.</p>
          <p>And in relation to the possibility of creating an offline tournament we were concerned that if we only asked users if they would like to have one they would overwhelmingly say yes but, in effect, participation could be quite low. Therefore, we left that question as last in the survey and before we asked them in their past participation in other real events, such as Bastille day or the Nuit Blanche (for Paris residents). That way we could gage the differential between their attitudes and actual response.</p>
          <p>Having all these methods described, drafted and prepared we issued the tests and waited to gathered and analyse the information.</p>
          <h3>The outcome</h3>
          <p>After collecting all the data and analysing it we’ve learned that some changes where required to the Tournament tutorial prototype in order to improve even further the information retention of users and so we did. After implementing the changes we issues a second test to see if our changes were effective and so they where. By the end of the tests user’s average correct response to our quiz was 8/10.</p>
          <p>Being satisfied with those improvements from design side we released our changes and noticed a 15% increase in tournament participation of unique users in comparison with the previous Tournament.</p>
          <p>In our offline Tournament survey we learned that our players not only had a impressive 83% desired to have an offline tournament but that 67% of them had participated in 2 or more events during the past year. That sedimented our confidence level that having an offline tournament was an interesting possibility that we think our users would not only appreciate but participate.</p>
          <p>In relation to our client implementation we noticed a series of inconsistencies that could be merged and simplified so that solving tasks could not only be identical across clients but also streamlined in all of them.</p>
          <p>For example, we were able to improve how the daily bonus was granted to players, changing it from three different implementations into a single one making use of a typical  spin-the-wheel mechanism that allowed us to bring more life and excitement to the action of receiving a bonus as well as allowing Live Operations to play with the value and add promotions that could offer players twice as much or additional spins. Something that was not possible with the old implementation that revolved around simply giving players a fixed amount per day.</p>
          <h3>Fin</h3>
          <p>All of these improvements really contributed to a better user experience not only within the ecosystem of our products but also our customer relationship and a possible future in live events.</p>
          <p>Even though the team was more then happy with the outcomes of its work, soon enough we had more ideas for more improvements, especially based on the smaller topics of our first survey. As all things in design, good enough is never enough.</p>
          <p>That is how we found ourselves advocating for a trip to France to sit down with our users and dive deep into their needs and fresh new features that they would love to see in the game. On that note, stay tooned for more and have a nice day!</p>
